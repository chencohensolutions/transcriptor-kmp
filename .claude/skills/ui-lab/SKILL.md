description: Build UX/UI suggestions as tappable mocks in Transcriptor's UI lab, record each round in docs/ux-history, and promote the chosen option into the app once the owner approves a plan. Use whenever the owner asks to suggest, mock up, compare or try UX/UI designs for a screen, or to bring back an earlier suggestion.

# UI lab: UX suggestions

A UX suggestion goes through three phases:

1. **Mock** — only lab code changes, on Android. The owner taps through the options.
2. **Close the round** — the round is tagged and written up in `docs/ux-history/`, and its lab files are deleted.
3. **Promote** — after the owner picks an option and approves a plan, it becomes the real screen, with its shared
   logic and the other platform.

## Platform

Android first: iOS is built after the Android app is finished (owner's decision, Nov 2, 2026), so mocks are made in
the Android UI Lab on every machine, on the owner's phone when `adb devices` lists it, else the emulator.

| Lab app | Lab code | Open |
|---|---|---|
| Android UI Lab (`com.chencohensolution.transcriptor.uilab`), beside Transcriptor | `androidApp/src/debug/` | `./scripts/ui-lab.sh <screen> [option]` (`DEVICE=emulator` or `DEVICE=<serial>` to choose) |

Once the iOS app exists its lab goes in `iosApp/iosApp/Lab/`, with the same screen and option ids, in SwiftUI.

How the lab itself works: [docs/previews.md](../../../docs/previews.md).

## Phase 1: mock

Work on a `ux/<screen>` branch from the current one, so the other machine can pull the round. If the tree has
uncommitted changes that aren't yours, ask before switching.

### One folder per option

Each option lives in its own folder, so it can be deleted, revived or promoted alone:

- Android: `androidApp/src/debug/kotlin/com/chencohensolution/transcriptor/ui/lab/<screen>/<b>/`, in the
  screens' package (`com.chencohensolution.transcriptor.ui`). Its strings files are in `src/debug/res/values/`
  and `values-iw/`, since Android resources can't sit in subfolders.
- iOS: `iosApp/iosApp/Lab/<Screen>/Option<B>/`, strings included.

| File (`.kt` / `.swift`) | Holds | On promotion |
|---|---|---|
| `<Screen>Option<B>` | the screen, `<Screen>Screen<B>(state, actions)`: production quality (strings from resources, `MaterialTheme` and `LocalTranscriptorColors`) and free of lab types | moves into the app |
| `<Screen>Option<B>State` | state the shared logic doesn't produce yet, shaped as the controller would produce it | moves to `sharedLogic` (from Swift, rewritten in Kotlin) |
| `<Screen>Option<B>Lab` | its sample data, fake behavior, do-nothing actions, and its `LabOption` value with what it fakes above it | deleted |
| strings: Android `strings_<screen>_<b>.xml` (names prefixed `<screen>_<b>_`); iOS `<Screen>Option<B>.xcstrings` (`table: "<Screen>Option<B>"`) | the option's new text | moves to the app's strings, without the prefix or table |

- Besides the folder and Android's strings files, an option adds one line: its entry in its screen's list in
  `LabScreens` (`momentsOptionB,`).
- Everything in the folder is `private` except the screen, its state and the `LabOption` value, whose names carry
  the option, so options never clash.
- An option that needs a changed version of an existing app component uses its own copy, in its folder.
- Sample data comes from `LabData` in the shared logic as it is, plus what the option adds in its
  `Lab` file.

### Steps

1. Open the screen in the lab and look at `current`, the screen as the app has it now.
2. Write 2–3 distinct directions as options `a`, `b`, `c` after `current`, each with a one-line note on what it
   changes.
3. Above each `LabOption` value, list what the option fakes: data the server or shared logic lacks, behavior that
   isn't built, and behavior made-up data can't show (timing, the microphone, live transcription, the models).
4. Check the edge cases: Hebrew (RTL) and an English notebook, long lines and notes, empty, paused, the keyboard open, and whatever is unusual for the screen.
   A case that changes the design becomes its own option (`a-rtl`).
5. Build, open each option and look at a screenshot:
   - iOS: `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot <file>.png`. `open -a Simulator` fails on this Mac; the launch works
     anyway.
   - Android: `adb -s <serial> exec-out screencap -p > <file>.png`, with the serial the script printed. An
     all-black screenshot from the phone means it is locked: ask the owner to unlock it.
6. Commit on the branch and tell the owner the option ids (`<screen> <option>`), what each fakes, and the device.

When the owner asks to change an option, the change becomes a new option in its own folder (`b2` beside `b`).
Options the owner rules out stay until the round closes, so the round's tag has them all.

## Phase 2: close the round

When the owner has picked an option or turned them all down:

1. Tag the round's last commit, while every option is still in it, and push the tag:
   `git tag ux/<screen>/<yyyy-mm-dd> && git push origin ux/<screen>/<yyyy-mm-dd>`. The tag keeps the code reachable
   after the branch is gone; a second round the same day gets `-2`.
2. Write `docs/ux-history/<screen>/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<topic>.md` in the format below, and link it from the screen's doc
   in `docs/screens/` under "Design history".
3. Delete the other options' folders, strings files and `LabScreens` lines; the chosen option stays until phase 3.
4. Commit. With every option turned down, the round ends here: merge the branch (the history file is its only
   lasting change) or delete it, as the owner prefers.

```markdown
# <Screen> — <topic> (<yyyy-mm-dd>, <iOS|Android>)

Tag: `ux/<screen>/<yyyy-mm-dd>`

## Options
- **a — <name>**: <what it changes>. *Picked*, promoted in <commit>.
- **b — <name>**: <what it changes>. *Turned down*: <the owner's reason, when given>.

## What they faked
- b: <what the mock showed that the app can't do yet>.

## Reviving an option
    git checkout ux/<screen>/<yyyy-mm-dd> -- <option folder> <strings files>
Then add `<screen>Option<B>,` to `LabScreens`.
Built against <components and sample data it used> as of the tag. Compile errors after reviving are in the
option's copies and sample data; fix them there.
```

### Reviving

When the owner asks for an earlier option, follow its history file: check out the paths from the tag onto a
`ux/<screen>` branch, add the `LabScreens` line, fix what no longer compiles inside the option's folder, and open it.
It is then a live option of a new round.

## Phase 3: promote

With the round closed on a picked option, enter plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`) and present the plan with
`ExitPlanMode`; the owner approves it with its button. The plan covers:

- the files that move and the screen they replace;
- the shared-logic work: the proposed state, controller methods and tests, and how each faked item gets built;
- the other platform: an entry in `docs/ios-todo.md` (iOS is built after Android is finished);
- the `docs/screens/` updates.

After approval, on the same branch:

1. `git mv` the option's screen file into the app (Android `src/main/kotlin/.../ui/`; iOS `iosApp/iosApp/`, without its `#if DEBUG`), replacing the old screen, and give the function or view the screen's name.
2. Move its strings into the app's (Android `src/main/res/`; iOS `Localizable.xcstrings`), without the prefix or
   table.
3. Move its state into `sharedLogic`, have the controller produce it with tests, and connect the actions.
4. Fold its copied components back into the originals, and delete the rest of its folder and its `LabScreens` line.
5. Build release, where any reference to lab code fails to compile: `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleRelease`, and on
   the Mac `xcodebuild -project iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj -scheme iosApp -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build`.
6. Do the plan's other-platform and `docs/screens/` parts, and put the promoting commit in the round's history file.

Merging the branch is the owner's call.
